# minecraft-2.0
Me being elitist about Minecraft (not a real code repo)

This is a theoretical branch off of Minecraft release 1.7.10 released in like, what, 2014? It's been too long... Especially right after my candle day!

The lore is that Notch got his character development and allowed himself to get a little more greedy and ended up telling Microsoft to buzz off. And then randomly hired me to be lead planner, like I was some random slobbering twitterite who begged to join despite having zero social skills or employment history and a liberal arts degree.

I will divide this into sections, I think:

  - Pulls from """""Java Edition"""""
  - System
  - Mechanics
  - Blocks
  - Mobs
  - World
  - Survival
  - ETC

I think, again. Otherwise, this is assumed to be Minecraft release 2.0 in another timeline. It's not really a 2.0 but I'm not calling it 1.8. And it'll be called the Update that Saved the World.
